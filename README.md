======
[Brimir](http://getbrimir.com/) is a simple helpdesk system that can be used to handle support requests
via incoming email. Brimir is currently used in production at [Ivaldi](http://ivaldi.nl/).

Installation
------------
Brimir is a rather simple Ruby on Rails application. The only difficulty in setting things up is how to get incoming email to work. See the next section for details.

Install the required gems by running:

    bundle install --without development:test
    
Next, load the database schema and some defaults, then precompile the assets:

    rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
    rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production

Last thing left to do before logging in is making a user and adding some statuses. You can do this by running:

    rails console
    Status.create([ { name: 'Open', default: true }, { name: 'Closed' }, { name: 'Deleted' } ])
    Priority.create([ { name: 'None', default: true }, { name: 'Low' }, { name: 'Medium' }, { name: 'High' } ])
    u = User.new({ email: 'your@email.address', password: 'somepassword', password_confirmation: 'somepassword' }); u.agent = true; u.save!

Incoming email
--------------
Incoming emails can be posted to the tickets url. First make a script like this on your mailserver:

    #!/bin/bash
    exec curl --data-urlencode message@- https://yourbrimirurl.com/tickets.json
    
Save it in `/etc/postfix/brimir.sh` for example.

Next, create an alias in your `/etc/aliases` file like this:

    brimir: "|/bin/bash /etc/postfix/brimir.sh"

Now sending an email to brimir@yourmailserver.com should start curl and post 
the email to your brimir installation.
