- Agents can now also be limited to certain labels, which lets them only manage tickets and replies with those labels.
- If a ticket detail page is opened by an agent, it will be locked to avoid multiple agents from replying to the same ticket. Tickets are unlocked five minutes after the agent leaves the ticket detail page or by clicking the link on ticket detail by not limited agents.
- The status of a ticket can now be changed directly when adding a reply.
- Nice name outgoing email address support, i.e. `From: Test <test@test.nl>` instead of just the email address.
- Opt-in other users in conversations.

- Per user configuration option for plain text replies.
- A global configuration page was added which can be used to set default locale and time zone.
- Added "equal to" as option for rule matching.
- Original email messages are now stored and available from the ticket detail page. This can be helpfull if Brimir fails to show some HTML mails correctly or to resolve possible bugs in Brimir.
- Farsi/Persian translation contributed by @hadifarnoud.
- Support for inline email attachments has been added. It will only work for newly received messages.
- Filter by user from tickets index. Contributed by @fiedl.

### Changed
- The outgoing email address of replies will now be the same as the original incoming email addresses when it was configured correctly as an outgoing email address. The agent can choose a different address when replying.
- The `script/post-mail` script now returns correct exit codes to the local delivery command of Postfix. This allows Postfix to bounce an email when the ticket could not be created.
- Ordering of tickets is now based on last modified time. Tickets with new replies will show up on top.
- Filter values are now case insensitive.

### Deprecated
